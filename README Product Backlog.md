User Stories:

1) As a school administrator, I want to add, update, and remove courses in the system, 
    so that students have access to accurate and up-to-date course offerings. 
    Priority: High Justification: Essential for maintaining course availability. (Adam)
2) As a school administrator, I want to assign instructors to specific courses,
    so that each course has a teacher before registration opens. 
    Priority: High Justification: Required for proper scheduling and staffing. (Adam)
3) As a school administrator, I want to create, update, and deactivate user accounts,
    so that I can maintain an accurate database of enrolled students and faculty. 
    Priority: Medium Justification: Important for system integrity, but not required before registration begins. (Adam)
4) As a student, I want to search for available courses and enroll in them,
   so that I can register for the classes I need.
   Priority: High Justification: Required to allow students to see all calls options and enroll. (Logan)

   so that I can plan my schedule effectively and avoid conflicts.
   Priority: Medium Justification: useful for students but not necessary for initial enrollment functionality. (Logan)
6) As a student, I want to see prerequisites and seat availability in the course search,
   so that I can enroll in the classes that aren't full.
    Priority: High Justification: Without this a student could enroll in a full class. (Logan)
7) As an instructor, I want to view and manage the list of students enrolled in  my courses,
    so that I can track attendance and academic performance. 
    Priority: Medium Justification: This feature is essential for efficient course administration but does not directly
    impact course availability or registration.
8) As a student, I want to be automatically added to a waitlist when a course is full,
    so that I have a chance to enroll if a spot opens.
    Priority: Medium Justification: Helpful for administration but doesn't block registration.
9) As an instructor, I want to set up course discussion forums,
    so that students can collaborate, ask questions, and know more about the course and instructor.
    Priority: Low Justification: This will enhance learning experiences and expectations for students,
    but it's not needed for basic course registration functions. (Long)
10) As an instructor, I want to generate performance reports from students,
    so that students can collaborate, ask questions, and know more about the course and instructor.
    Priority: Low Justification: This is useful for improving teaching, but it's not a vital function for course registration. (Long)
